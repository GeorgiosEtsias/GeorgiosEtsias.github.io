## Citing this work

This project is part of the Saline Intrusion in Coastal Aquifers ([SALINA](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/R019258/1)) research project. 
Data acquisition and analysis was conducted in Queen’s University Belfast (2019-2020). Funding was provided by EPSRC Standard Research (Grant No. EP/R019258/1).

The work was published under the title:

Etsias, G.; Hamill, G.A.; Benner, E.M.; Águila, J.F.; McDonnell, M.C.; Flynn, R.; Ahmed, A.A. Optimizing Laboratory Investigations of Saline Intrusion by Incorporating Machine Learning Techniques. Water 2020, 12, 2996. DOI: [10.3390/w12112996](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/12/11/2996).  

## Project overview
Deriving saltwater concentrations from the values of light intensity is a long-established image processing practice in laboratory scale investigations of saline intrusion. The current repository presents a novel methodology that employs the predictive ability of machine learning algorithms in order to determine saltwater concentration fields. The proposed approach consists of three distinct parts, image pre-processing, ground profile classification (bead structure recognition) and saltwater field generation (regression). It minimizes the need for aquifer-specific calibrations, significantly shortening the experimental procedure by up to 50% of the time required.

A graphical outline of the investigation

## Image pre-processing

Current part filters out the impact of back lighting in the experimental images by formulating a novel variable name Mean Homogenization Factor. This significantly helps neural training in the next stages of the investigation.

Scripts: [MeanHomoFactorCalculator.m](https://github.com/GeorgiosEtsias/Computer-Vision-Sandbox-Images/blob/main/1%20Image%20pre-processing/MeanHomoFactorCalculator.m)

Datasets: subset1.mat, subset2.mat, subset3.mat, subset4.mat

## Classification

This part derives the heterogeneous structure (strata) of the test aquifers by conducting classification analysis on freshwater-only test images.

## Common error

When neural training using relatively big datasets (similar to the ones in this repository) is attempted, MATLAB might return an out-of-memory error. 

In the conference paper titled ['The effect of colour depth and image resolution on laboratory scale study of aquifer saltwater intrusion'](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343976955_The_effect_of_colour_depth_and_image_resolution_on_laboratory_scale_study_of_aquifer_saltwater_intrusion) our research team proved that in the laboratory studies of saltwater intrusion, images of reduced dimension can still recreate high quality saltwater concentration fields. The imeresize.m built in MATLAB function is an easy way of modifying the available datasets.
