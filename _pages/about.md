I am a civil/environmental engineer with a solid background in machine learning, image analysis and experimental data filtering. I have conducted research in the United Kingdom, United States and Greece. 

I have over 3.5 years of professional experience in the acquisition and processing of experimental data in environmental research projects. In the past 2 years I have been working on the application of machine learning techniques (ANNs, SVMs, decision trees) on the analysis of experimental images of groundwater flow. 

I am proficient in three programing languages, and have a deep knowledge of statistics and optimization algorithms.
