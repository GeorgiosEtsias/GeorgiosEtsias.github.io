I am a Belfast-based civil/environmental engineer and an aspiring data scientist, with a solid background in machine learning, image analysis and experimental data acquisition and filtering. I have conducted research in the United Kingdom, the United States and Greece.

I currently work on the application of machine learning techniques (ANNs, SVMs, decision trees) on the analysis of experimental images of groundwater flow. I am proficient in three programming languages, and have a deep knowledge of statistics and optimization algorithms.
